We define how our organization generates ideas, documents them, and evolves strong concepts into tangible initiatives.  
This space represents our **ideation culture**, **working principles**, and **decision boundaries**.

## Why we exist 🎯

![Purpose](https://img.shields.io/badge/Purpose-Problem--Driven-blueviolet)

Our purpose is to encourage **problem-oriented thinking**, produce **innovative and sustainable ideas**, and gradually mature selected ideas into concrete projects.

This includes:
- New product and service ideas  
- Improvements to existing systems and processes  
- Continuous evaluation of emerging technologies

## What this repository is 📌

![Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repository-Idea%20Pool-lightgrey)

This is **not a code repository**.  
It is a **structured idea pool** and **methodology reference**.

It allows us to:
- Capture ideas consistently  
- Track ideas from early drafts to mature proposals  
- Maintain a shared evaluation language

## Ideation model ⚖️

![Freedom](https://img.shields.io/badge/Freedom-Encouraged-success)
![Responsibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/Responsibility-Required-critical)

### Freedom
- Early-stage ideas can be shared without immediate technical or commercial constraints  
- Experimental, unconventional, and incomplete ideas are welcome  
- Ideas that later prove impractical still create learning value  

### Guidelines
- Use respectful, constructive, and ethical language  
- Do not include personal data, confidential information, or legal risks  
- Whenever possible, describe:
  - the problem  
  - the value proposition  

Our goal is **not to limit creativity**, but to ensure a **productive and sustainable environment**.

## AI-assisted ideation 🤖

![AI](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI-Human%20in%20the%20Loop-informational)

AI-powered tools may be used to support ideation and refinement:

- Structuring raw ideas  
- Exploring alternative perspectives  
- Identifying potential risks and edge cases  
- Improving clarity and documentation quality  

AI outputs are **supportive inputs**, not final decisions.  
Final responsibility always remains human-driven.

## Core principle 🧭

![Principle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Principle-Document%20First-important)

Idea generation is a process.  
Not every idea must become a product.

**Value begins when ideas are documented.**

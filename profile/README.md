We define how our organization generates ideas, documents them, and evolves strong concepts into tangible initiatives.  
This space represents our ideation culture, working principles, and decision boundaries.

## Why we exist 🎯

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Purpose-Problem--Driven-blueviolet" />

Our purpose is to encourage **problem-oriented thinking**, produce **innovative and sustainable ideas**, and gradually mature selected ideas into concrete projects.

This includes:
- New product and service ideas  
- Improvements to existing systems and processes  
- Continuous evaluation of emerging technologies and approaches

## What this repository is 📌

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Repository-Idea%20Pool-lightgrey" />

This is **not a code repository**.  
It is a **structured idea pool** and **methodology reference**.

It enables us to:
- Capture ideas in a consistent and traceable format  
- Track ideas from early drafts to mature proposals  
- Maintain a shared language and evaluation approach

## Ideation model ⚖️

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Freedom-Encouraged-success" />
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Responsibility-Required-critical" />

### Freedom
- Early-stage ideas can be shared without immediate technical or commercial constraints  
- Experimental, unconventional, and incomplete ideas are welcome  
- Ideas that later prove impractical still generate learning value  

### Guidelines
- Use respectful, constructive, and ethical language  
- Do not include personal data, confidential information, or legally sensitive content  
- Whenever possible, clearly describe:
  - the problem  
  - the value proposition  

Our goal is not to limit creativity, but to ensure a **productive and sustainable environment**.

## AI-assisted ideation 🤖

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/AI-Human%20in%20the%20Loop-informational" />

AI-powered tools may be used to support ideation and refinement processes, including:
- Structuring raw ideas  
- Exploring alternative perspectives  
- Identifying potential risks and edge cases  
- Improving clarity and documentation quality  

AI outputs are **supportive inputs**, not final decisions.  
Final evaluation and accountability always remain human-driven.

## Status 🚧

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Idea%20%7C%20Draft%20%7C%20Evaluation-yellow" />

This repository is actively maintained.

Ideas here:
- Are not production-ready products  
- Are not completed projects  
- Exist in conceptual, draft, or evaluation stages  

Selected ideas may later be developed into dedicated project repositories.

## Core principle 🧭

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Principle-Document%20First-important" />

Idea generation is a process.  
Not every idea must become a product.

**Value begins when ideas are documented.**
